# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model, implemented from scratch using the Normal Equation and Gradient Descent, with visualization of results. The model is trained on a sample dataset and tested with Mean Squared Error.

## Files

- `linear_regression.py`: Python script for loading data, training the model, testing, and visualizing results.
- `train.csv` and `test.csv`: Sample datasets for training and testing the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages needed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/NoumanSultan/MachineLearning/tree/main/Linear_Regression)>
